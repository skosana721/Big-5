            2) Leopard Behavior is Secretive and Territorial

        </h3>
        <p>
            Adult leopards are solitary animals and only spend time with others to mate and to raise their young.

           Each leopard spends most of its life in its own territory. And to warn other leopards to stay away, they leave scratches on trees, and urine scent marks around their areas.

           They also rub their faces against vegetation along other pathways and territory boundaries. In doing so, they transfer secretions from the cheek glands, which can also carry olfactory messages.
