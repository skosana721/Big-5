        <p>
         On average a buffalo herd consists of 12 animals made up of females, their offspring and one to three males. Other males will form a bachelor herd or live on their own. These solitary males are usually the most aggressive and dangerous.

                2) Buffalo Herd Life Offers Safety in Numbers
            </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
         Living as a herd offers many benefits, like sharing the best grazing areas and water holes, but it also offers safety in numbers. The lion is the natural predator of the buffalo. When the herd is under attack they will form a circle around the young, old or weak members and use their large, sharp and deadly horns to protect them and fight off the predator. This is usually very effective.

             3) African buffalo's speed

        </h3>
        <p>
            Although not the fastest bovine at 35mph (56kph), African Buffalo can still outrun lions. However, predators can accelerate quicker making the buffalo easy to ambush.
