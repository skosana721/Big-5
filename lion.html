                1) LIONS ARE SOCIAL
            </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Of all the big cat species in the world, lions are the most social. They live together in large groups known as "prides". The size of a pride can range in size from 15 to 40 members. These prides include multiple adult males, a dozen or more related females and the pride's cubs. In general, the more members a pride has, the stronger it is relative to rival prides. The prideâ€™s females also prefer to have more males in the pride as this helps to ensure the survival of their cubs.

            <strong>
                2) FEMALE LIONS DO MOST OF THE HUNTING, WHILE MALES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE PRIDE
            </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Male lions may get all of the attention with their majestic manes, but the females do the majority of the work when it comes to hunting. Anywhere from 85-90% of the hunting is done by the females in a given pride. The males, meanwhile, protect both the pride and the pride's territory (which can extend up to 100 square miles) from rival prides and other predators. Even though females do the vast majority of the hunting, male lions usually get to eat first!

                3) LIONS ARE THE SECOND LARGEST CAT ON EARTH
            </strong>
         </h3>
        <p>
            After tigers, lions are the largest wild cats on the planet. Male lions can grow up to 10 feet in length and weigh up to 550 pounds, while female lions can grow to a length of 9 feet and weigh up to 395 pounds.

                4) LIONS ARE UNDER THREAT
            </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
         Only 20,000 wild lions remain in Africa, which is half of what it was only 30 years ago. Some scientists predict that wild lions could face extinction by the year 2050 if trends continue and humans don't increase their efforts to protect these amazing and powerful animals.

         The main threats to lions are loss of territory, lion/human conflict, and trophy hunting. As a traveler, you can do your part by traveling to national parks and game reserves that put resources toward protecting Africa's lions.
