      <p>
        
        Elephants tend to hear or smell things first and then train their sight, instead of using vision as their primary sensory input. They keep track of their family members and non-family members using just their sense of smell.

            2) Contact appeal
          
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     Anatomically, the olfactory region of the elephant’s brains is particularly active and extremely developed compared to its other senses. The mechanism works this way. When two elephants approach, they automatically emit something called the contact appeal. If they recognize the appeal, they respond in a friendly manner. If not, they adopt a defensive position

          3) Trunk
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The trunk weighs around 130kg and is capable of lifting about 250kg. It is also extremely dexterous, sensitive and mobile, which makes it appear independent from the rest of the body. Anatomically, elephant trunk is a combination of the nose and upper lip. The nostrils are at the tip.

            4) Memory
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
Elephants are known for their sharp memory power. The extraordinary recalling power of elephants both in the wild and in captivity has been fodder for many fascinating stories, both fiction and non-fiction. Ancient legend has it that elephants never forget. That may be bit of an exaggeration and a myth concocted by oldwives for many generations. It seems more likely that they forget. Although the theory is a myth, it doesn’t stray too far from the truth. There is surely some truth in it because science, studies and research have proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that elephants do possess incredibly and exceptionally long memory power for certain things with the ability to keep information for many decades.
